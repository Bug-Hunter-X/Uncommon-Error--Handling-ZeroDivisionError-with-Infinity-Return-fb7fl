This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` handles the case of division by zero by returning infinity (`float('inf')`). This avoids the typical `ZeroDivisionError`, but it could lead to unexpected behavior or downstream errors in calculations that involve the returned value. The solution shows the implementation of a more robust error handling mechanism by raising a custom exception, providing better error indication and control flow for applications.
